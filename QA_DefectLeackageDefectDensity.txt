Defect Leakage vs Defect Density (Explained Clearly)
1️⃣ What is Defect Leakage?
📌 Definition

Defect Leakage is the percentage of defects that escape to a later testing phase or production, even though they should ideally have been caught earlier.

👉 In simple terms:

“How many bugs slipped through?”

🔁 Example (Very Practical)
Phase	Defects Found
System Testing	90
UAT	15
Production	5

Defects leaked = 15 + 5 = 20

🧮 Formula
Defect Leakage (%) =
(Defects found in later phase ÷ Total defects) × 100


Using example:

(20 ÷ 110) × 100 = 18.18%

🎯 Why Defect Leakage Matters
High Leakage Indicates	Meaning
Weak test coverage	Missed scenarios
Poor requirement understanding	Gaps
Late testing	Shift-right
Inadequate reviews	No shift-left
🔥 Real Production Leakage Example

Login works in test

Fails with real SSO token in prod
➡ Environment parity issue

🧠 How Leaders Use Leakage

✔ Assess QA effectiveness
✔ Identify risky releases
✔ Justify investment in automation
✔ Improve early testing

2️⃣ What is Defect Density?
📌 Definition

Defect Density measures the number of defects relative to the size of the software.

👉 In simple terms:

“How buggy is this component?”

🧮 Formula
Defect Density =
Number of defects ÷ Size of software

Size can be:

KLOC (thousand lines of code)

Function Points

Story Points (Agile adaptation)

Modules / Features

🧪 Example

Defects found: 40

Code size: 10 KLOC

Defect Density = 4 defects per KLOC

🧠 Agile Example (Common Today)

Defects: 12

Story Points: 60

Defect Density = 0.2 defects per story point

🎯 Why Defect Density Matters
High Density Means	Implication
Complex code	Needs refactoring
Poor design	Technical debt
Rushed delivery	Quality risk
New team	Learning curve
🔁 Defect Leakage vs Defect Density (Side-by-Side)
Aspect	Defect Leakage	Defect Density
Measures	Escaped defects	Defects per size
Focus	Test effectiveness	Product quality
Used by	QA Leads, Managers	Architects, Leads
Phase-based	Yes	No
Predictive	Medium	High
🧠 How Senior QA Use Both Together
Example Insight:

“Module A has low defect density but high leakage.”

Meaning:

Code quality is good

Tests are missing real-world scenarios

Another:

“High defect density but low leakage”

Meaning:

Many bugs, but QA is catching them early

Needs dev quality improvement

🎯 Interview-Perfect Summary

“Defect leakage measures how many defects escape to later phases, reflecting test effectiveness, while defect density measures defects relative to software size, reflecting overall product quality.”

🧠 Senior QA Insight

Leakage tells you where QA failed.
Density tells you where the product is weak.
