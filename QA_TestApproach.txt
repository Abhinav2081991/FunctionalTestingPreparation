What Is Test Approach?
✅ Simple Definition

Test Approach defines how testing will be performed to meet quality objectives within given constraints.

If Test Strategy answers “what & why”,
👉 Test Approach answers “how”.

🎯 Purpose of Test Approach

The test approach explains:

How testing is structured

How risks are mitigated

How different test types are executed

How tools, environments, and people are used

It guides day-to-day testing execution.

🧱 What Does a Test Approach Typically Include?

A well-defined test approach covers execution-level decisions, such as:

1️⃣ Testing Levels

How testing is distributed across levels:

Unit

Integration

System

UAT

Example:

Unit tests by devs, API tests by QA, UI tests minimal and critical only.

2️⃣ Testing Types

Which types are applied and how:

Functional

Regression

Smoke

Performance

Security

Usability

Localization

Example:

Regression automated, exploratory manual each sprint.

3️⃣ Test Design Techniques

How test cases are derived:

Boundary Value Analysis

Equivalence Partitioning

Decision Tables

Exploratory testing

4️⃣ Risk-Based Testing

How risk influences testing depth:

Example:

Payment flows tested exhaustively; reporting tested lightly.

5️⃣ Automation Approach

What is automated and where:

API-first automation

CI/CD execution

Parallel execution strategy

6️⃣ Test Environment Usage

How environments are used:

Dev / QA / UAT

Data reset strategy

Feature flags

7️⃣ Defect Management

How defects are:

Logged

Triaged

Fixed

Re-tested

8️⃣ Entry & Exit Criteria

When to start and stop testing:

Example:

Start testing when story is “Ready”; exit when DoD met.

9️⃣ Collaboration Model

Who does what:

QA responsibilities

Dev collaboration

Business involvement

🧠 Test Approach vs Test Strategy (Very Important)
Aspect	Test Strategy	Test Approach
Focus	High-level direction	Execution-level details
Scope	Project / Program	Phase / Sprint
Stability	Relatively stable	Adaptive
Detail	What & Why	How
Audience	Management	Team
🔥 Example Test Approach (Agile)

Testing will follow a shift-left approach with developers responsible for unit tests and QA focusing on API and UI validation. Critical user journeys will be automated and executed in CI. Exploratory testing will be conducted each sprint. Risk-based testing will guide test depth. Defects will be managed within sprint backlog.

🔥 Example Test Approach (Waterfall)

Testing will be executed phase-wise with system testing followed by UAT. Manual test cases will be designed based on requirements. Regression testing will be performed after defect fixes. Entry and exit criteria will govern phase completion.

🎯 Interview-Ready Definition

Test approach defines the overall methodology and techniques used to carry out testing activities, including test levels, test types, risk handling, automation strategy, environment usage, and defect management.

🧠 Senior QA Insight

A test approach should change when risks, constraints, or delivery models change — not because of tools or trends.

✅ Final Takeaway

Test Strategy sets the direction.
Test Approach drives execution.
