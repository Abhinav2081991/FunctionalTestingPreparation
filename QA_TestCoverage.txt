What is Test Coverage?
📌 Definition

Test Coverage measures how much of the application is exercised by tests.

In simple words:

“What part of the system is tested vs what exists?”

⚠️ Important:
Coverage ≠ Quality
Coverage only tells you reach, not depth.

🧠 Types of Test Coverage (Very Important)

Test coverage is not one thing. There are multiple dimensions.

1️⃣ Requirements Coverage
What it measures

% of requirements / user stories tested

Formula
(Tested requirements ÷ Total requirements) × 100

Example

Total stories: 50

Covered: 45
➡ 90% requirement coverage

Used by

✔ Product owners
✔ Auditors
✔ Leadership

2️⃣ Code Coverage (Most Popular, Most Misused)
What it measures

% of source code executed by tests

Common types
Type	Meaning
Line	Lines executed
Branch	if/else paths
Method	Methods called
Condition	Boolean expressions
Example
Line Coverage = 75%


⚠️ High code coverage does NOT guarantee correctness

3️⃣ Functional Coverage
What it measures

Features and business flows tested

Example

Login tested

Forgot password tested

MFA tested

More meaningful than code coverage for QA.

4️⃣ Test Case Coverage
What it measures

% of test cases executed vs planned

Used heavily in:

Test cycles

UAT

Releases

5️⃣ Risk Coverage (Senior-Level Metric)
What it measures

Coverage of high-risk areas

Examples:

Payment flows

Security

Compliance

Data migration

This is what leadership actually cares about.

6️⃣ API Coverage
What it measures

Endpoints tested vs total endpoints

Example:

80 out of 100 endpoints tested
➡ 80% API coverage

7️⃣ UI Coverage
What it measures

Screens / workflows tested via UI

Should be low but strategic (Test Pyramid).

🔁 Test Coverage vs Test Pyramid (Connection)
Pyramid Layer	Coverage Goal
Unit	High code coverage
API	High functional coverage
UI	High business coverage (low volume)
🚫 Common Myths (Very Important)
❌ “We have 90% coverage, so we’re safe”

Wrong.

❌ “More tests = better coverage”

No — redundant tests don’t add coverage.

❌ “Coverage is only a dev metric”

QA owns functional and risk coverage.

🧠 How Senior QA Explain Coverage to Leadership

“Our test coverage focuses on business-critical and high-risk flows, not just raw percentages.”

🎯 Interview-Perfect Summary

“Test coverage measures how much of the system is exercised by tests. It includes requirement, code, functional, and risk coverage. High coverage improves confidence, but coverage alone does not guarantee quality.”

🧠 Senior QA Insight

Coverage tells you what was touched.
Quality tells you how well it was tested.
