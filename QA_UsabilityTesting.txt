What Is Usability Testing?
✅ Definition
📌 Simple Definition

Usability testing evaluates how easy, efficient, and satisfying a product is for real users to accomplish their goals.

📌 Professional Definition (ISO-style)

Usability testing is a type of non-functional testing that assesses a system’s effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction in a specified context of use.

🎯 Purpose of Usability Testing

Usability testing answers questions like:

Can users complete tasks without confusion?

Is the interface intuitive?

Are error messages clear and helpful?

Does the product feel natural to use?

👉 It focuses on user experience, not system correctness.

🧱 Core Usability Attributes

Based on ISO 9241 / ISO 25010:

1️⃣ Effectiveness

Can users complete tasks successfully?

2️⃣ Efficiency

How much time and effort is required?

3️⃣ Learnability

How quickly can new users learn the system?

4️⃣ Memorability

Can returning users use it without relearning?

5️⃣ Error Handling

Are errors prevented or easy to recover from?

6️⃣ Satisfaction

Do users enjoy using it?

🧪 Examples of Usability Issues
Area	Issue
Navigation	Users can’t find key features
Forms	Too many mandatory fields
Errors	Cryptic error messages
UI	Inconsistent button placement
Accessibility	Poor contrast, no keyboard support
🧠 Usability Testing vs Functional Testing
Aspect	Functional Testing	Usability Testing
Focus	Does it work?	Is it easy to use?
Who	QA / Automation	Real users / UX
Nature	Objective	Subjective
Automation	High	Low / Limited
Outcome	Pass/Fail	Insights & improvements
🧪 Types of Usability Testing
1️⃣ Exploratory Usability Testing

Early feedback

Paper prototypes, wireframes

2️⃣ Task-Based Testing

Users complete defined tasks

Measure success rate and time

3️⃣ Moderated Usability Testing

Facilitator observes and asks questions

4️⃣ Unmoderated Usability Testing

Users perform tasks independently

Tools record behavior

5️⃣ A/B Testing

Compare two UI designs

🧠 When to Perform Usability Testing
Phase	Activity
Design	Prototype testing
Development	Iterative feedback
Pre-release	Validation
Post-release	Continuous improvement

👉 Best usability testing happens early and continuously.

🧪 Tools Used for Usability Testing
🔹 Manual / Observation

In-person sessions

Screen recordings

🔹 Analytics

Heatmaps (Hotjar)

Click tracking

🔹 Accessibility Tools

Axe

Lighthouse

🧠 Role of QA in Usability Testing (Senior View)

QA contributes by:

Identifying usability risks

Defining usability acceptance criteria

Validating accessibility standards

Supporting UX with data

Automating basic usability checks (limited)

🚫 What Usability Testing Is NOT

❌ Not just UI testing
❌ Not pixel-perfect validation
❌ Not only for designers
❌ Not fully automatable

🎯 Interview-Ready Explanation

Usability testing evaluates how effectively, efficiently, and satisfactorily users can interact with a system. Unlike functional testing, it focuses on user experience, ease of use, and intuitiveness rather than correctness of functionality.

🧠 Final Takeaway

A system can be functionally correct yet unusable.
Usability testing ensures the product actually works for humans.
