Lambda Expression vs Anonymous Inner Class
1️⃣ Basic Definition
🔸 Anonymous Inner Class

A class without a name

Used to implement an interface or extend a class

Exists since Java 1.1

Runnable r = new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running");
    }
};

🔸 Lambda Expression

A short, functional-style way to implement a functional interface

Introduced in Java 8

Works only with functional interfaces (single abstract method)

Runnable r = () -> System.out.println("Running");

2️⃣ Key Differences (Table)
Aspect	Anonymous Inner Class	Lambda Expression
Syntax	Verbose	Concise
Java Version	Java 1.1+	Java 8+
Functional Interface	Not required	Required
this keyword	Refers to inner class	Refers to enclosing class
Can define fields	Yes	❌ No
Can have multiple methods	Yes	❌ No
Readability	Lower	Higher
Boilerplate	High	Minimal
3️⃣ this Keyword Difference (IMPORTANT)
Anonymous Inner Class
this   // refers to anonymous inner class instance

Lambda Expression
this   // refers to enclosing class instance


👉 This can cause subtle bugs if misunderstood.

4️⃣ Variable Capture Rules
Anonymous Inner Class

Can access final or effectively final variables

Lambda Expression

Same rule

But more natural & cleaner

int x = 10;

Runnable r = () -> {
    // x = 20; ❌ not allowed
    System.out.println(x);
};

5️⃣ Performance Difference

Lambda expressions are implemented using invokedynamic

Usually more efficient

Anonymous classes create separate .class files

👉 In modern JVMs, lambdas are generally lighter.

6️⃣ When Anonymous Inner Class is Still Needed

✔ When you need:

Multiple methods

State (fields)

To extend an abstract class (not functional)

Example:

Thread t = new Thread() {
    int count = 0;

    @Override
    public void run() {
        count++;
    }
};

7️⃣ Practical Usage in Automation (Selenium / Streams)
Before Java 8
wait.until(new ExpectedCondition<Boolean>() {
    public Boolean apply(WebDriver driver) {
        return driver.getTitle().contains("Home");
    }
});

With Lambda
wait.until(driver -> driver.getTitle().contains("Home"));


✔ Cleaner
✔ More readable
✔ Less error-prone

🧠 Interview-Ready One-Liner

“An anonymous inner class is a traditional way to implement interfaces or extend classes using verbose syntax, while a lambda expression provides a concise way to implement functional interfaces introduced in Java 8, with better readability and performance.”

🔥 Summary

✔ Lambdas = functional + concise
✔ Anonymous class = flexible but verbose
✔ Lambdas improve readability in modern Java
✔ Use anonymous class when multiple methods/state is needed
