Git Squash — What, Why, When (Senior-Level Explanation)
🧠 What is Git Squash?

Git squash means combining multiple commits into a single commit.

The final code stays the same — only commit history changes.

🔧 What Does Squash Do Internally?

Takes multiple commits

Rewrites them as one new commit

Generates a new commit hash

Removes intermediate commit messages (unless you keep them)

📌 History is rewritten

🪜 How Squash is Done (Most Common Way)
Using Interactive Rebase
git rebase -i origin/main


Change:

pick a1 Add API tests
pick b2 Fix assertion
pick c3 Remove debug log


To:

pick a1 Add API tests
squash b2 Fix assertion
squash c3 Remove debug log

📘 Resulting History
Before Squash
A --- B --- C

After Squash
A'


📌 Single meaningful commit

🎯 When Should Git Squash Be Used?
✅ Use Squash When

✔ Feature development created multiple WIP commits
✔ Fixing mistakes incrementally
✔ Cleaning history before PR
✔ PR has “noise” commits
✔ Small logical unit of work

❌ When Squash Should NOT Be Used

❌ On shared branches
❌ After commits are reviewed & approved
❌ For logically independent changes
❌ In audit-heavy environments (finance, healthcare)

🔥 Real QA Automation Example
During Development
Add login API test
Fix status code assertion
Fix JSON schema
Remove println

After Squash
Add login API validation with schema checks


✔ Reviewer focuses on what, not how many fixes

🧠 Squash vs Merge vs Rebase (Quick Context)
Action	Purpose
Squash	Clean commit history
Rebase	Reapply commits on new base
Merge	Combine branches

📌 Squash is often part of interactive rebase

⚠️ Risks of Squash

Loses step-by-step evolution

Harder to bisect issues later

Can hide flaky test history

💡 Seniors decide intentionally, not by habit

🎯 Interview-Perfect Answer (30 sec)

“Git squash combines multiple commits into one to keep history clean. I typically use it on my private feature branch before creating a PR to remove WIP and fix-up commits. I avoid squashing shared or already reviewed commits because it rewrites history.”

🧠 One-Line Memory Hook

Squash removes noise, not knowledge.

🏁 Senior Takeaway

Git squash is not about aesthetics —
it’s about respecting the reviewer’s time.
