Git Mistakes Only Senior Engineers Make (Real World)
1️⃣ Over-optimizing Git History (and Breaking People)
The Mistake

Aggressively rebasing shared branches
Force-pushing “beautiful” history

Why Seniors Do This

Strong engineering standards
Desire for clean logs
Damage
Teammates lose commits
CI breaks
Trust erosion

Senior Fix

“History cleanliness is secondary to team safety.”

✔ Rebase only private branches
✔ Merge shared branches

2️⃣ Assuming Everyone Understands Git Like You Do
The Mistake

Advanced workflows without documentation

Expecting juniors to “just know”
Damage
Mistakes propagate
Fear of Git
Silent errors
Senior Fix

✔ Write Git playbooks
✔ Add safe defaults
✔ Protect branches

3️⃣ Force-Pushing Under Pressure
The Mistake
git push --force

Why

Release pressure
CI failure panic
Damage
Lost commits
Broken release trails

Senior Fix

✔ Use --force-with-lease
✔ Communicate before pushing

4️⃣ Rebasing Too Late
The Mistake

Letting a branch drift for weeks
Rebasing hundreds of commits at once
Damage
Massive conflicts
Increased risk of error

Senior Fix

✔ Rebase/merge daily
✔ Short-lived branches

5️⃣ Cherry-Picking Without Understanding Dependencies
The Mistake
git cherry-pick <commit>


…but commit depended on earlier changes

Damage
Tests fail mysteriously
Partial logic
Senior Fix

✔ Inspect commit history
✔ Prefer PR-based fixes

6️⃣ Treating Git as “Just a Tool”
The Mistake

Ignoring Git’s role in:

Audits
Compliance
RCA
Damage
No traceability
Weak postmortems

Senior Fix

✔ Enforce commit message standards
✔ Link Jira → PR → commit

7️⃣ Cleaning History Instead of Fixing Root Cause
The Mistake

Squashing flaky commits
Deleting “ugly” test failures
Damage
Flakiness persists
Same bugs reappear

Senior Fix

“History tells a story — don’t erase it.”

✔ Fix test stability
✔ Preserve evidence

8️⃣ Overusing Git Aliases (Team Confusion)
The Mistake
alias gco='git checkout'

Damage
Pair programming confusion
Onboarding friction

Senior Fix

✔ Document aliases
✔ Keep commands explicit in docs

9️⃣ Allowing “Temporary” Git Exceptions
The Mistake

“Just this once, force-push”  “Skip PR for hotfix”

Damage
Becomes the norm
Process erosion

Senior Fix

✔ Emergency path documented
✔ Post-incident correction

🔟 Not Using Git as a Leadership Tool
The Mistake

Git seen only as version control
No governance
Missed Opportunity
Quality gates
Accountability
Learning

Senior Fix

✔ Branch protection
✔ Required reviews
✔ CI enforcement

🧠 Meta-Mistake: Thinking Git Mastery Is About Commands
Reality

At senior level:

Git = risk management

Git = collaboration

Git = traceability

🎯 How to Talk About These in Interviews

Use this structure:

“I’ve made this mistake earlier in my career, here’s the impact, and here’s how I prevent it today.”

Interviewers LOVE:
✔ Self-awareness
✔ Growth
✔ Prevention mindset

🏁 Final Senior Takeaway

If you’ve never made these mistakes…
you probably haven’t worked at scale 😉
