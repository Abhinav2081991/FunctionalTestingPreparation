Estimation Techniques a Senior / Lead QA (12+ yrs) MUST Know
🔑 First Principle (Interview Gold)

Estimation is risk management, not math

A senior QA:

Estimates effort + risk

Uses multiple techniques together

Continuously refines estimates

🟢 1️⃣ Expert Judgment (Most Used at Senior Level)
📌 What it is

Estimation based on:

Past experience

Similar projects

Known pitfalls

📍 Example (QA)

“A login flow with OAuth, MFA, and rate-limiting usually takes ~3–4 days including automation.”

✅ Pros

Fast

Accurate when done by experienced people

❌ Cons

Biased

Not auditable

🔥 Senior Tip
Always support expert judgment with historical data.

🟢 2️⃣ Analogous Estimation (Very Practical)
📌 What it is

Estimate based on similar completed work.

📍 Example

“Last release had 5 APIs and took 8 QA days. This release has 10 APIs → ~16 QA days.”

✅ Pros

Easy to explain

Good early-phase estimates

❌ Cons

Assumes similarity

Less accurate for new domains

📌 Common in:

Early Agile planning

SAFe PI planning

🟢 3️⃣ Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
📌 What it is

Break QA work into granular tasks:

Test design

Automation

Data setup

Execution

Regression

Defect verification

📍 Example
Login Feature QA:
- Test case design: 4h
- Automation: 6h
- Execution: 2h
- Bug retest: 2h
Total = 14h

✅ Pros

Highly accurate

Transparent

❌ Cons

Time-consuming

Needs discipline

🔥 Leadership-grade estimation

🟢 4️⃣ Story Point Estimation (Agile)
📌 What it is

Relative estimation using:

Fibonacci (1, 2, 3, 5, 8…)

📍 QA Perspective

Estimate:

Test complexity

Automation scope

Data & env risk

📍 Example
Story	QA Complexity
Simple UI validation	2
API + UI + negative cases	5
Cross-system integration	8
❗ Important

QA does not estimate time here — only complexity.

🟢 5️⃣ Three-Point Estimation (PERT)
📌 What it is

Accounts for uncertainty

Estimate = (O + 4M + P) / 6


O = Optimistic

M = Most likely

P = Pessimistic

📍 Example (QA Automation)

O = 2 days

M = 4 days

P = 8 days
➡ Estimate = ~4.3 days

✅ Pros

Risk-aware

Good for leadership conversations

❌ Cons

Needs mature thinking

🔥 Perfect for complex integrations

🟢 6️⃣ Bottom-Up Estimation (Gold Standard)
📌 What it is

Estimate at task level, then roll up.

📍 Example

Feature A: 10 hrs

Feature B: 14 hrs

Feature C: 6 hrs
➡ Total QA = 30 hrs

✅ Pros

Highly reliable

Defensible

❌ Cons

Heavy upfront work

📌 Used in:

Large releases

Regulated environments

🟢 7️⃣ Top-Down Estimation (Executive-Level)
📌 What it is

Leadership-driven estimate, then validated by QA.

📍 Example

“We need this tested in 2 weeks — what can QA realistically cover?”

⚠️ QA Lead Role

Identify risk

Negotiate scope

Suggest trade-offs

🔥 A senior QA never blindly accepts top-down estimates.

🟢 8️⃣ Parametric Estimation (Advanced / SAFe)
📌 What it is

Uses metrics-based formulas.

📍 Example
1 QA Day = 5 Test Cases
Total test cases = 100
QA Effort = 20 days

✅ Pros

Data-driven

Scales well

❌ Cons

Needs historical accuracy

📌 Used in:

SAFe

Enterprise programs

🟢 9️⃣ Risk-Based Estimation (VERY IMPORTANT)
📌 What it is

Effort varies based on risk level.

Risk	Effort
High	+40%
Medium	+20%
Low	Base
📍 Example

Payments module → add buffer
Static content → minimal QA

🔥 Senior QA always adds risk buffers consciously.

🟢 🔟 Monte Carlo Simulation (Leadership Level)
📌 What it is

Probability-based forecasting using multiple simulations.

📍 Used for:

Release forecasting

SAFe PI predictability

📌 Often used with tools (JIRA, Excel, Jira Align).

🧠 Estimation Techniques by Context
Context	Best Techniques
Agile sprint	Story points + Expert
New project	Analogous + PERT
Regulated domain	WBS + Bottom-up
SAFe PI	Parametric + Risk-based
Executive planning	Top-down + Validation
🎯 How a 12-Year QA Should Answer in Interview

“I don’t rely on a single estimation technique. I usually combine analogous estimation with work breakdown, add risk buffers using three-point estimation, and validate against historical metrics. For Agile, I focus on relative complexity using story points, while for SAFe I rely more on parametric and risk-based estimation.”
