What is a Key in SQL?

A key is a column (or set of columns) used to:

Uniquely identify a row

Enforce data integrity

Create relationships between tables

Improve performance (indexes)

1️⃣ Primary Key (PK)
👉 What it is

Uniquely identifies each row

Cannot be NULL

Cannot have duplicates

Only one PK per table

Example
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);

✔ Key points

Automatically creates a unique index

Best candidate identifier

2️⃣ Unique Key
👉 What it is

Ensures uniqueness

NULL is allowed (DB-dependent)

Multiple unique keys allowed per table

Example
CREATE TABLE UserAccount (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);

PK vs Unique (quick)
Primary Key	Unique Key
Only one	Multiple allowed
No NULL	NULL allowed
Main identifier	Alternate identifier
3️⃣ Foreign Key (FK)
👉 What it is

Creates relationship between tables

Ensures referential integrity

Example
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (emp_id) REFERENCES Employee(emp_id)
);

✔ Enforces

Parent row must exist

Prevents orphan records

4️⃣ Composite Key (Compound Key)
👉 What it is

Key made of multiple columns

Together they ensure uniqueness

Example
CREATE TABLE Enrollment (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)
);

5️⃣ Candidate Key
👉 What it is

All columns that can qualify as a Primary Key

Must be unique & NOT NULL

Example
Employee table:
- emp_id
- email


Both can uniquely identify rows → both are candidate keys
One is chosen as PK, the rest become alternate keys

6️⃣ Alternate Key
👉 What it is

Candidate keys not selected as Primary Key

Example
Primary Key: emp_id
Alternate Key: email


Usually implemented using UNIQUE constraint

7️⃣ Super Key
👉 What it is

Any combination of columns that uniquely identifies rows

Includes unnecessary columns

Example
(emp_id)
(emp_id, name)
(emp_id, email)


All are super keys, but only the minimal one is a candidate key.

8️⃣ Natural Key
👉 What it is

Business-meaningful key

Comes from real-world data

Examples
Email
SSN
Aadhaar number

⚠️ Risk

Business rules change

Data may not stay immutable

9️⃣ Surrogate Key
👉 What it is

Artificial/system-generated key

No business meaning

Examples
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT
UUID
SEQUENCE

✔ Preferred in most systems

Stable

Small

Fast joins

10️⃣ Secondary Key
👉 What it is

Non-unique key used for searching/filtering

Often indexed

Example
CREATE INDEX idx_emp_name ON Employee(name);

11️⃣ Partial Key (Weak Entity)
👉 What it is

Used with weak entities

Needs parent key to be unique

Example
OrderItems:
(order_id, item_no)

🧠 Summary Table (Interview Gold)
Key Type	Unique	NULL	Purpose
Primary Key	Yes	No	Row identifier
Unique Key	Yes	Yes*	Alternate uniqueness
Foreign Key	No	Yes	Table relationship
Composite Key	Yes	No	Multi-column PK
Candidate Key	Yes	No	PK candidates
Alternate Key	Yes	No	Non-chosen PK
Super Key	Yes	No	Superset of candidate
Natural Key	Yes	No	Business identity
Surrogate Key	Yes	No	System-generated
Secondary Key	No	Yes	Search performance

* DB dependent

🎯 Interview Tip (Senior-level answer)

“I prefer surrogate primary keys for stability and performance,
and enforce business uniqueness using unique constraints.”

That line alone signals real-world DB experience.
