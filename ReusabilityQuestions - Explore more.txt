SECTION 1: Cucumber DataTable – Advanced & Real-World
1️⃣ How is Cucumber DataTable internally represented?

Expected depth

List<List<String>>

List<Map<String, String>>

Map<String, String>

Custom POJO mapping via @DataTableType

2️⃣ When would you prefer DataTable over Scenario Outline + Examples?

Look for

Atomic step reuse

Multi-column form filling

Complex structured inputs

Partial execution inside steps

3️⃣ Explain the difference between:
| username | password |


vs

| key | value |


Expected answer

Horizontal vs Vertical table

Map vs List<Map>

Flexibility vs strictness

4️⃣ How do you convert DataTable into a domain object?

Expected

@DataTableType
public User userEntry(Map<String, String> row) {
    return new User(row.get("name"), row.get("email"));
}

5️⃣ What problems arise when using raw List<Map<String,String>>?

Strong answers

Tight coupling to column names

Runtime errors

No compile-time safety

Poor refactorability

6️⃣ How do you validate partial DataTables?

Example:

| field | expected |
| name  | Abhinav  |


Expected

Iterative assertion strategy

Map-driven validation

Soft assertions

7️⃣ How do you handle dynamic / optional columns in DataTable?

Expected

Optional getters

Defensive null checks

Default values

Column normalization

8️⃣ Can DataTables be reused across steps?

Expected

Yes via transformation

No via direct sharing

Store in Scenario Context

🔹 SECTION 2: Scenario Parameterization (Beyond Basics)
9️⃣ Why Scenario Outline is NOT always a good idea?

Look for

Step explosion

Maintenance overhead

Tight coupling

Loss of scenario intent

🔟 Difference between:

Scenario Outline

DataTable

External test data (JSON / CSV)

Criteria	Outline	DataTable	External
Readability	High	Medium	Low
Scalability	Low	Medium	High
Reuse	Poor	Good	Excellent
1️⃣1️⃣ How do you parameterize conditional flows?

Expected

Feature flags in DataTable

Switch logic in step

Avoid Gherkin branching

1️⃣2️⃣ How do you handle environment-specific test data?

Expected

Config-driven resolution

Token replacement

Context-based overrides

1️⃣3️⃣ How do you prevent duplicate test coverage with Scenario Outline?

Expected

Equivalence class partitioning

Boundary-value strategy

Risk-based selection

1️⃣4️⃣ How do you pass complex objects across steps?

Expected

Scenario Context

PicoContainer DI

Avoid static storage

🔹 SECTION 3: Reusability Patterns (Senior-Level Focus)
1️⃣5️⃣ How do you design reusable steps WITHOUT making them generic?

Look for

Action-based steps

Domain language

Avoid UI-specific verbs

1️⃣6️⃣ Difference between Step Reuse and Step Abstraction

Strong answer

Reuse duplicates behavior; abstraction hides complexity.

1️⃣7️⃣ How do you avoid tight coupling between Step Definitions and Pages?

Expected

Page exposes business actions

Steps call intent-based methods

DIP compliance

1️⃣8️⃣ How do you handle reusable flows with different assertions?

Expected

Flow methods return state

Assertion delegated to steps

Strategy pattern

1️⃣9️⃣ What anti-patterns exist in Cucumber reuse?

Look for
❌ “Swiss Army Steps”
❌ Conditional logic in steps
❌ UI terminology in feature files
❌ Over-parameterization

2️⃣0️⃣ How do you share state safely between steps?

Expected

Scenario-scoped TestContext

PicoContainer

No statics

No singletons

🔹 SECTION 4: DataTable + Reusability Combined
2️⃣1️⃣ Design a reusable step for form submission using DataTable

Expected approach

DataTable → POJO

Page.fillForm(User)

Validation outside page

2️⃣2️⃣ How do you validate tables returned from API using DataTable?

Expected

Expected vs Actual mapping

Partial field comparison

Order-insensitive checks

2️⃣3️⃣ How do you implement default values in DataTables?

Expected

Optional columns

Builder pattern

Data normalization

2️⃣4️⃣ How do you reuse the same DataTable across UI & API tests?

Expected

Domain model mapping

Decoupled transport layer

Same object, different executor

🔹 SECTION 5: Architecture & Best Practices
2️⃣5️⃣ How does SOLID influence Cucumber step design?

Expected

SRP: One intent per step

ISP: Small step interfaces

DIP: Steps depend on abstractions

2️⃣6️⃣ How do you keep Feature files readable for non-technical users?

Expected

Business language

No locators

No technical jargon

Declarative intent

2️⃣7️⃣ How do you refactor flaky DataTable-driven tests?

Expected

Stabilize waits

Remove hidden dependencies

Normalize input data

Improve assertions

2️⃣8️⃣ How do you version DataTables safely?

Expected

Schema validation

Backward compatibility

Migration helpers

🔹 SECTION 6: Lead / Architect Questions
2️⃣9️⃣ How would you train juniors to use DataTable correctly?

Expected
Usage guidelines
Code reviews
Patterns library
Examples vs anti-examples

3️⃣0️⃣ If you had to audit a legacy Cucumber suite, what would you check first?

Expected

Step duplication
Parameter misuse
Scenario outline explosion
Maintenance cost

🎯 FINAL INTERVIEW TIP (VERY IMPORTANT)

If you are 12+ years experienced, interviewers expect:

WHY, not HOW

Trade-offs

Design thinking

Maintainability over syntax

Anyone can write DataTable code.
Seniors design sustainable test systems.
