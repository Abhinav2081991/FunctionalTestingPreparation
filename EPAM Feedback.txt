[11:31 am, 18/01/2026] Tej EPAM Hr: Summary
The candidate has 12  years of experience in software testing. Based on the technical interview , the candidate demonstrates a solid foundation and hands-on exposure across core test automation areas, however the overall code maturity, depth in advanced concepts, and framework-level ownership are aligned up to L3 expectations rather than L4.

 
Strengths
Demonstrates a good understanding of Core Java, particularly in writing and executing programs using collections such as ArrayList and HashMap.
Shows practical experience with Java-based test automation, including TestNG and BDD frameworks (Cucumber).
Comfortable working within Agile methodologies and able to explain testing activities in Agile teams; understanding is good up to L3 level.
Has hands-on experience in UI automation, including writing dynamic XPath expressions.
Displays reasonable Exposer on API core concepts and its use
Communication skills are clear and effective during technical discussions.
Exposure to BDD and test automation practices is adequate for L3 responsibilities.
 
Areas for Improvement / Gaps Identified
Code maturity is limited; lacks deeper design-level thinking expected at senior levels (L4).
Java 8 features (Streams, Lambdas, functional programming) need strengthening for modern automation frameworks.
Advanced BDD concepts such as extensive use of DataTable, scenario parameterization, and reusability patterns are limited.  -- Done.
CI/CD exposure exists but is limited; implementation-level understanding and ownership are suitable only up to L3. -- Done.
Testing process knowledge such as Test Strategy, Test Plan, and end-to-end quality ownership needs improvement.
Advanced API testing concepts (Mocking, complex validations, integration strategies) require deeper hands-on experience. -- Done.
Limited exposure to Agile process , estimation approaches , RCA part -- Done.
Code management , practical use of design patterns in framework -- Done.
 
Recommendation
Based on the discussion, the candidate demonstrates good technical fundamentals and experience in Java, TestNG, UI automation, BDD, and API testing. However:
On visibility on advanced code maturity
CI/CD, Agile process understanding, and BDD implementation are good but only up to L3 level


Recommendation: Suitable for L3 role
(Not recommended for L4 at this stage)
Red flag comment
No
