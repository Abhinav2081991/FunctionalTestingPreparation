What are “Main” Design Patterns?

When people say main design patterns, they usually mean two big buckets:

1️⃣ GoF (Gang of Four) Design Patterns
2️⃣ Dependency Injection / Inversion of Control (IoC) (architectural patterns, not GoF)

They solve different classes of problems.

1️⃣ GoF (Gang of Four) Design Patterns
📘 Origin

Introduced in 1994

Book: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software

Authors: Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides

🎯 Purpose

Solve recurring object-oriented design problems in a reusable way.

They are code-level design solutions.

🧩 GoF Categories (3 Types)
A️⃣ Creational Patterns

Concern: How objects are created

Pattern	Problem it solves	Automation Example
Factory	Centralized object creation	DriverFactory
Singleton	Single shared instance	ConfigLoader
Builder	Complex object construction	API Request POJO
Prototype	Clone objects	Test data templates
Example – Factory (Selenium)
WebDriver driver = DriverFactory.create("chrome");

B️⃣ Structural Patterns

Concern: How objects are composed

Pattern	Problem it solves	Automation Example
Decorator	Add behavior dynamically	Retry / Logging
Adapter	Make incompatible APIs work	Selenium → Custom API
Proxy	Control access	Lazy driver
Facade	Simplify complex systems	TestService
Composite	Tree-like structures	Page components
Example – Decorator
new RetryDecorator(
   new LoggingDecorator(
      new ClickAction()
   )
);

C️⃣ Behavioral Patterns

Concern: How objects interact

Pattern	Problem it solves	Automation Example
Strategy	Swap behavior at runtime	Browser strategy
Observer	Event notification	Test listeners
Command	Encapsulate requests	Test steps
Template	Algorithm skeleton	Test execution flow
Chain of Responsibility	Sequential handlers	Validation chain
Example – Strategy
DriverStrategy strategy = new ChromeStrategy();

🔑 Key Traits of GoF Patterns

✔ Object-oriented
✔ Language-agnostic
✔ Focused on design reuse
✔ Mostly manual wiring

2️⃣ Dependency Injection (DI) & Inversion of Control (IoC)

⚠️ Not GoF patterns

These are architectural principles/patterns.

🔄 Inversion of Control (IoC)
📌 Definition

The control of object creation and dependency management is inverted from the application code to a container/framework.

❌ Without IoC
LoginPage page = new LoginPage(new ChromeDriver());

✅ With IoC
LoginPage page; // framework injects dependencies

💉 Dependency Injection (DI)
📌 Definition

Dependencies are provided to a class rather than created by it.

DI is one way to achieve IoC.

🔑 Why DI Matters (Especially in QA)
Problem	How DI solves
Tight coupling	Inject abstractions
Hard to mock	Inject test doubles
Scattered creation	Centralized wiring
Parallel execution	Scope control
🧩 Types of Dependency Injection
1️⃣ Constructor Injection (BEST)
public LoginPage(WebDriver driver) {
    this.driver = driver;
}


✔ Immutable
✔ Testable
✔ Clear dependencies

2️⃣ Setter Injection
public void setDriver(WebDriver driver) {
    this.driver = driver;
}


⚠ Optional dependencies

3️⃣ Field Injection (NOT recommended)
@Inject
WebDriver driver;


❌ Hard to test
❌ Hidden dependencies

🧰 IoC Containers
Tool	Usage
Spring	Enterprise apps
Guice	Lightweight
PicoContainer	Cucumber
JUnit Extensions	Modern tests
Example – Cucumber PicoContainer
public class LoginSteps {

    private final LoginPage loginPage;

    public LoginSteps(LoginPage loginPage) {
        this.loginPage = loginPage;
    }
}

🆚 GoF vs DI/IoC (Very Important)
Aspect	GoF	DI / IoC
Scope	Code-level	Architecture-level
Purpose	Solve design problems	Manage dependencies
Manual wiring	Yes	No
Testability	Helps	MASSIVELY improves
Automation usage	Heavy	Mandatory
🔥 How They Work Together (Real Framework)
IoC Container
   ↓ injects
Factory → Strategy → Decorator
   ↓
Page Objects


IoC orchestrates, GoF solves problems inside.

🎯 Interview-Perfect Explanation

“GoF patterns solve object-oriented design problems like creation, composition, and behavior. Dependency Injection and IoC are architectural approaches that manage how dependencies are provided, enabling loose coupling, testability, and scalability. In automation frameworks, IoC wires GoF patterns together.”
