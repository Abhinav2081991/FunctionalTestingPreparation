Test Levels & Test Types (Explained Clearly)
✅ What Are Test Levels?
📌 Definition

Test Levels describe when testing is performed in the software development lifecycle and what level of the system is being tested.

They answer:
“At which stage and scope are we testing?”

🧱 Test Levels (Top → Bottom)
1️⃣ Unit Testing
🔹 What It Tests

Individual units of code (methods, classes)

In isolation

🔹 Who Performs

Developers (primarily)

🔹 Tools

JUnit, TestNG, Mockito

🔹 Example
assertEquals(5, calculator.add(2,3));

2️⃣ Integration Testing
🔹 What It Tests

Interaction between integrated components

APIs, DB, services

🔹 Who Performs

Developers / QA

🔹 Example

Service ↔ Database

API ↔ External system

3️⃣ System Testing
🔹 What It Tests

Entire application as a whole

Functional & non-functional

🔹 Who Performs

QA team

🔹 Example

End-to-end login

Order placement flow

4️⃣ Acceptance Testing
🔹 What It Tests

Business requirements

User acceptance criteria

🔹 Who Performs

Business users / PO / QA

🔹 Example

UAT

Alpha / Beta testing

🧠 Test Levels Summary Table
Level	Scope	Focus
Unit	Smallest	Code correctness
Integration	Interfaces	Data flow
System	Full system	Behavior
Acceptance	Business	Fit for use
✅ What Are Test Types?
📌 Definition

Test Types describe what kind of testing is performed to evaluate specific quality characteristics.

They answer:
“What are we testing for?”

🔹 Functional Test Types
✔ Functional Testing

Features work as expected

✔ Smoke Testing

Build stability check

✔ Regression Testing

Existing features still work

✔ Sanity Testing

Quick validation of fixes

🔹 Non-Functional Test Types
⚡ Performance Testing

Load, stress, scalability

🔐 Security Testing

Vulnerabilities, auth, data protection

♿ Usability Testing

User experience

🌍 Compatibility Testing

Browsers, OS, devices

🌐 Localization / Internationalization

Language, locale, formats

🔄 Reliability & Recovery

Failover, stability

🔹 Structural Test Types
🧠 White Box Testing

Code-based

Paths, conditions

🧪 Black Box Testing

Behavior-based

No code knowledge

🧩 Gray Box Testing

Partial internal knowledge

🧪 Other Important Test Types

Exploratory Testing

Accessibility Testing

Compliance Testing

API Testing

Contract Testing

Chaos Testing (microservices)

🔍 Test Levels vs Test Types (Key Difference)
Aspect	Test Levels	Test Types
Focus	When & where	What
Based On	SDLC stage	Quality attributes
Examples	Unit, Integration	Performance, Security
Dependency	Hierarchical	Orthogonal

👉 Test types can be applied at any test level.

🧠 Real-World Example
Login Feature
Level	Type
Unit	Functional
Integration	API
System	UI regression
Acceptance	UAT
🎯 Interview-Ready Answer

Test levels define the stage and scope of testing such as unit, integration, system, and acceptance, while test types define the purpose of testing like functional, performance, security, and usability. Test types can be executed at multiple test levels depending on risk and objectives.

🧠 Senior QA Insight

Mature teams align test levels with the test pyramid and choose test types based on risk, not habit.
