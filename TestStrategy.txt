<MAIN Branch> 1. In Software product testing there is a switch from Waterfall:  model to Agile: .  What changes should be accommodated Test Strategy document? Explain with details.
Answer: “When moving from Waterfall:  to Agile: , the Test Strategy changes from a static, phase-based document to a living document. Testing becomes continuous, aligned with user stories and acceptance criteria. Automation becomes mandatory within the sprint, regression is incremental, environments are used early, and quality ownership shifts from QA to the entire Agile:  team. The strategy is reviewed and refined every sprint or release.”


1️⃣ Test Strategy Ownership & Mindset
Waterfall: 
Test strategy is created once, early in the project
Owned mainly by QA team
Rarely updated

Agile: 
Test strategy is a living document
Owned collectively (QA + Dev + Product)
Reviewed every release / PI

📌 Test Strategy Change
Test Strategy will be reviewed and refined at the beginning of every release
and updated based on sprint learnings and retrospectives.

2️⃣ Testing Phases → Continuous Testing
Waterfall: 
Requirements → Design → Dev → Testing → UAT → Prod

Agile: 
Plan → Code → Test → Feedback → Improve (Every Sprint)


📌 Strategy Update
Remove “System Testing Phase”, “Integration Phase”

Introduce:
Continuous Testing
Shift-Left Testing
Early Validation

Testing activities will start from Sprint 0 and continue throughout
the sprint lifecycle including design and development stages.

3️⃣ Test Planning Approach
Waterfall: 
Detailed master test plan
Test cases written upfront
Heavy documentation

Agile: 
Sprint-level test planning
Lightweight documentation
Just-enough test cases

📌 Test Strategy Update
Sprint-wise test planning will be performed during Sprint Planning,
focusing on acceptance criteria and risk-based testing.

4️⃣ Requirement Handling (CRITICAL CHANGE)
Waterfall: 
Stable requirements
Change requests handled formally

Agile: 
Requirements evolve every sprint
User Stories & Acceptance Criteria drive testing

📌 Test Strategy Update
Testing will be aligned to User Stories and Acceptance Criteria.
Test cases will be updated dynamically as stories evolve.

5️⃣ Test Design & Documentation
Waterfall: 
Detailed test cases
High traceability upfront

Agile: 
Acceptance criteria-based testing
BDD / Gherkin preferred
Exploratory testing encouraged

📌 Strategy Update
Test scenarios will be derived from acceptance criteria.
BDD approach will be adopted where applicable to improve collaboration.

6️⃣ Automation Strategy (MAJOR SHIFT)
Waterfall: 
Automation after manual testing
Mostly regression automation

Agile: 
Automation is mandatory
Sprint automation
CI/CD integrated

📌 Test Strategy Update
Automation will be implemented within the sprint.
Regression suite will be executed as part of CI/CD pipelines.


Include:
Automation Pyramid
Tool stack
Coverage expectations per sprint

7️⃣ Regression Testing Approach
Waterfall: 
Large regression cycle before release

Agile: 
Incremental regression every sprint
Automated first, manual fallback

📌 Strategy Update
Regression testing will be executed incrementally every sprint,
with priority given to automated regression suites.

8️⃣ Test Environment Strategy
Waterfall: 
Single shared environment
Late environment availability

Agile: 
Early & frequent environment usage
Mocking & stubs

📌 Strategy Update
Test environments will be provisioned early.
Service virtualization and mocks will be used where dependencies are unavailable.

9️⃣ Defect Management & Metrics
Waterfall: 
Defect leakage tracked post-testing
QA owns defects

Agile: 
Team owns quality
Defects discussed daily

📌 Strategy Update
Defects will be logged and triaged daily during sprint.
Quality metrics will be reviewed in sprint retrospectives.


Metrics change from:
❌ Test Case Count
➡️ ✅ Defect Escape Rate, Automation Coverage, Story Pass Rate

🔟 Release & Sign-off Strategy

Waterfall: 
Formal test sign-off at end

Agile: 
Incremental sign-off
Definition of Done (DoD)

📌 Strategy Update
Quality sign-off will be based on Definition of Done,
including test coverage, defect thresholds, and automation status.

Agile strategy emphasizes small, fast regressions.

9️⃣ Test Environment Usage
Area                                                  Waterfall                                             Agile
Environment Access                                    Late                                                  Early
Dependency Handling                                   Wait & test                                           Mocks / stubs
Stability                                             One stable env                                        Multiple evolving envs

Agile Test Strategy must handle incomplete dependencies.
