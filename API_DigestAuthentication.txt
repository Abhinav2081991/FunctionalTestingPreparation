What is Digest Authentication?

Digest Authentication is an HTTP authentication mechanism where:

The password is never sent over the network,
instead a hash (digest) of credentials + request data is sent.

It was designed to fix the biggest weakness of Basic Auth.

⚠️ Problem with Basic Authentication

Basic Auth sends:

Authorization: Basic Base64(username:password)


Issues:

Base64 is not encryption

Credentials can be decoded easily

Requires HTTPS to be safe

✅ How Digest Authentication Works (Step-by-Step)

Digest Auth uses a challenge–response mechanism.

1️⃣ Client sends request (no auth)
GET /secure-resource

2️⃣ Server responds with 401 + challenge
WWW-Authenticate: Digest
  realm="test-realm",
  nonce="abc123",
  qop="auth"

3️⃣ Client sends hashed response
Authorization: Digest
  username="user",
  realm="test-realm",
  nonce="abc123",
  uri="/secure-resource",
  response="9f4e3..."


✔ Password is never sent
✔ Hash changes per request

🧠 What is inside the Digest?

The hash is usually:

MD5( MD5(username:realm:password) : nonce : MD5(method:uri) )


So even if intercepted:

Cannot reverse to get password

Replay attacks are harder

🧪 Digest Authentication in Rest Assured
✅ Example Code
given()
    .auth()
    .digest("username", "password")
.when()
    .get("/secure-endpoint")
.then()
    .statusCode(200);


Rest Assured automatically:

Handles the challenge

Generates digest hash

Sends correct headers

🆚 Basic vs Digest Authentication
Feature	Basic	Digest
Password sent	Yes (Base64)	❌ No
Challenge-response	❌	✅
Replay protection	❌	Partial
HTTPS required	Mandatory	Recommended
Complexity	Simple	More complex
Modern usage	Rare	Legacy
⚠️ Important Limitations of Digest Auth

❌ Uses MD5 (cryptographically weak today)
❌ Not suitable for modern APIs
❌ Poor support in mobile/cloud APIs
❌ No fine-grained scopes/claims

That’s why…

🚀 Why Digest Auth Is Rare Today

Most modern systems use:

OAuth 2.0

JWT / Bearer tokens

mTLS

Digest is mostly seen in:

Legacy systems

Network devices

Embedded systems

Old enterprise apps

🧠 Interview-Ready One-Liner

Digest Authentication improves on Basic Auth by using a challenge–response mechanism where hashed credentials are sent instead of plain passwords, reducing exposure to credential theft.

✅ When Should You Test Digest Auth?

✔ Legacy enterprise APIs
✔ Network hardware APIs
✔ Backward-compatible systems
